ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sakhile Khuzwayo

Iâ€™m interested in web development, particularly using React and other JavaScript frameworks. I am also interested in learning about design and user experience.

 Iâ€™m currently studying towards completing my diploma in Software development, and learning advanced topics in React, such as hooks and context, as well as design principles and best practices in my free time.
