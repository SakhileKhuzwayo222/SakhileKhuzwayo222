ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SakhileKhuzwayo222
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, particularly using React and other JavaScript frameworks. I am also interested in learning about design and user experience.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying towards completing my diploma in Software development, and learning in my own time advanced topics in React, such as hooks and context, as well as design principles and best practices.

You can reach me by email at sakhilekhuzwayo454@gmail.com or on Twitter at @SakhileKhuzwayo222.

âš¡ Fun fact
I am a self-taught developer and have been learning to code for the past 2 years. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and trying new recipes.
